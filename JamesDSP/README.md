# Additional Resource files for JamesDSP

*Convolver (IRS) and Viper4Android (DDC) profiles*

### Preamble

As we had the great opportunity to include JamesDSP audio effects libraries
courtesy of the talented james3460297 and the DSPManager including the
V4AToolbox courtesy of Team DeWitt, we are able to enhance the sound of our
officially build devices significantly.

### Purpose and Installation

The files included in this directory serve the purpose of configuration
and enhancement files for our JamesDSP Manager.
If copied to the right directory, they can be chosen from inside the DSPManager
for a) Convolver adaptions or b) DDC Equalizer enhancements.

Convolver or IRS files are configurations for accessories like headphones
or headsets to provide a better and calibrated user experience on these, when
listening to Music or Media files on the device or via bluetooth.

DDC or VDC profiles are used for almost the same purpose, but are designed for
being processed differently. The format is compatible with the (old) Viper4Android
as of versions <=2.5.x as of now and provide a stronger effect when activated.

To Install one or more these files, download them to your device and copy them
into the corresponding JamesDSP folder in the root path of your internal storage:

\JamesDSP
         --> Convolver  (*.irs files in this folder)
         --> DDC        (*.vdc files in this folder)
         --> Presets    (your saved DSP Manager configs are stored here!)

Once copied, you can open and use the files in the DSP Manager.

Keep in mind that only ONE config should be used and using more than one configuration
plus heavily modded other settings might lead to a bad experience. Be careful!

### Notes

We want to state that the configuration are/were part of the A.R.I.S.E. Sound
Systems package and were provided by their contributors.
We asked for permission on using them in their original form after the project was
stopped and abandoned.
So, we like to thank the contributors to A.R.I.S.E. for the permission to use this part 
of their work, namely guitardedhero, Roi007leaf, wrongway213, sonophilos, churapa,
